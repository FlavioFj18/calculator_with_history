# Basic Calculator in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project is a **basic calculator** designed to reinforce fundamental concepts of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, including DOM manipulation, events, responsive layout, and state management in simple web applications.

## Features

- Input numbers and basic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)  
- Calculate results by clicking the `=` button  
- Clear the display with the `C` button  
- Remove the last character with the backspace button  
- View a history of previous calculations

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: structure of calculator elements, display, buttons, and history  
- **CSS**: responsive layout using Flexbox and Grid, colors, typography, and interactive styles  
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, event handling, calculation logic, and dynamic history updates

## Concepts Reinforced

1. DOM manipulation: `getElementById`, `querySelectorAll`, `createElement`, `appendChild`  
2. Events: `addEventListener` for handling clicks and executing functions  
3. State management: input validation, updating the display, and maintaining history  
4. Responsive layout: relative units (`%`, `vw`), `clamp()`, and CSS Grid for adaptive UI  
5. History structure: array management and dynamic DOM updates

## Project Structure

/calculator/
├── index.html # Calculator markup
├── styles.css # Styles and responsive layout

## Notes

- Pure implementation without external libraries  
- Ideal for beginners looking to reinforce front-end fundamentals  
- Can be extended with keyboard support, advanced operators, and visual improvements

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser  
2. Click the buttons to input numbers and operators  
3. Use `C` to clear the display, `←` to delete the last character  
4. View the calculation history below the display
